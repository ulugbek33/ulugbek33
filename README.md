## Hi there 👋
# 👋 Hello, I am a Java Backend Developer!

💻 I am currently studying **Java Backend** at PDP Academy.

📚 I have just completed the course and gained experience working with:
**Spring Framework**, **Spring Boot**, **Telegram Bots**, **REST API**, and **PostgreSQL**.

🚀 My goal is to create useful technological products in Uzbekistan — especially
to develop **games**, **scientific**, and **cultural platforms** in the Uzbek language.
